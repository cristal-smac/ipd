    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Game theory is the discipline that formally studies the interactions that can occur between several individuals in a strategic situation. The term \"game\" is not a priori a playful term, Von Neumann having developed it for the modelling of conflict interactions. In particular, it has been used to model and simplify many problems ranging from trade relations to armed conflicts. Game theory decomposes games according to the number of players (usually 2), then mainly into two main families: simultaneous games, in which players play simultaneously and therefore do not know when playing what the opponent is playing (for example, Rock Paper Scissors) and non-concurrent games where everyone plays in turn (chess for example). \n",
    "\n",
    "We are here in the context of the **two-player, simultaneous** games. This kind of game is usually represented by a payoff matrix. The moves of one of the two players are on the abscissa and those of the other on the ordinate. The intersection of each square characterizes a game situation. It contains the points that will be distributed to each of the two players. For information, game theory further decomposes these games into two other families: zero-sum games in which everything lost by one is won by the other, and non-zero-sum games in which the winner can win more points than what is lost by the loser.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sheet aims to show how to represent and generate games, then how to calculate the different equilibriums of a game.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A payoff matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, it is necessary to be able to code a payoff matrix. A `Game` class will allow us to store the winnings of both players for a given situation. \n",
    "A Game object takes as parameter an array of pairs of integers corresponding to the scores of each outcome of the game, as well as a table of the names of the corresponding actions.\n",
    "Internally, the *numpy* package offers an ideal `Array` object to store and manipulate this. For a game with `n` choice options for each player, we create a `n*n` array of pairs of values `(x,y)` with `x` the win of player 1 and `y` the win of player 2.\n"

    "# The equilibrium notion\n",
    "\n",
    "Economists very quickly took advantage of these models to study different economic problems. In order to identify the best way to play a fixed game, they based themselves on the abstract notion of player rationality. Assuming that, in the worst case scenario, the opponent is also rational, the reasoning I apply must therefore also be applied to my opponent. Very quickly, several definitions of rationality appeared, thus defining one (or possibly several) fixed point of a game, point towards which rationally, if everyone thinks in the same way, we will reach:\n",
    "1. *The Nash equilibrium*, from the name of its inventor, [John Forbes Nash](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Forbes_Nash). Nash equilibrium is a situation of no regret for each of the players. *\"we played simultaneously, but now that I know what the other one played, I have no regrets \"*\n",
    "2. *The Pareto optimum*, from the name of its inventor, [Vilfredo Pareto](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilfredo_Pareto). The Pareto Optimum is a situation where no situation is superior for both players, and therefore they have no collective interest in changing.\n",
    "3. *The dominant strategy equilibrium*. A \"rational\" player will never play one of his strategies if it is dominated by another of his strategies. We can therefore \"simplify\" a game by iteratively eliminating the dominated strategies.\n",

    "## The Nash equilibrium\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the \"no regret\" situation corresponding to the Nash equilibrium, it is sufficient to note the answers of player 1 most adapted to the possible choices of player 2 (therefore calculate the max(x) in each column), then calculate the best answers of player 2 to the possible choices of player 1 (therefore calculate the max(y) in each line). If an issue has 2 max, then it is a Nash equilibrium. Depending on the games, there may of course be 1, several or none at all. \n",
    "The use of a `np.Array` makes things much easier since it is possible to have the max value vectors in line or in column. It is therefore sufficient to create Boolean matrices in each case and compute a `or` logical on them."
